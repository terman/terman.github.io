    <h2>Canyons!  &mdash; Summer 2016</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="19 June 2016" location="Lake Powell" pix="IMG_2346.jpg">
      There's nothing quite as dramatic like 12.7 million acre feet of
      water in the middle of the high desert.  After 16 years of drought,
      this is only half of its design capacity, which you can see visually
      as a 60' "bathtub ring" of white stone around the edge of the lake.
      Amazing fact: the length of the lake perimeter, with its myriad
      of ins and outs from the side canyons, is longer than the coast line
      of the west coast.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="18 June 2016" location="Monument Valley" pix="IMG_2278.jpg">
      We started the day with a side trip to Natural Bridges National
      Monument -- this is Owachomo Bridge.  What?...  Oh, good question!
      A bridge is formed by the cutting action of a river, usually as
      it slices through the fin of rock in the middle of a meander.  An arch
      has the same shape, but its center hole was formed by the subtler action
      of differential erosion of softer rock layers, which opens windows
      that slowly expand into arches.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2286.jpg">
      My John Ford moment here in Monument Valley.  (Ford shot a lot of
      John Wayne movies here.)
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2303.jpg">
      I'd love to say that all the formations in Monument Valley had this
      lovely golden glow, but mostly they're dusty red/brown, just like
      we were after the tour.  But when the sun is at the magic angle...
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2317.jpg">
      Deserts are at their best as the sun drops, the light softens,
      and the shadows provide some drama.
    </div>
    

    <div class="entry" title="17 June 2016" location="Island in the Sky" pix="IMG_2256.jpg">
      Island in the Sky (part of Canyonlands National Park) lies between
      the valleys of the Green River and Colorado River, isolated from the
      lowlands by 1000' cliffs -- revealing the cross section of the
      sedimentary layer cake called the Colorado Plateau.  Dramatic views
      apparently bring out the urge to pose your loved one as close to the
      precipice as possible!  "Just a few more steps back, dear..."
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2243.jpg">
      Plants have many different survival stategies in this arid climate.
      Junipers actually cut off water to one or more branches when times
      are tough, leaving many of them a mix of vibrant growth and the
      skeletons of branches that gave their all to ensure survival.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2260.jpg">
      This must have been what the praries looked like before their
      fragile habitat was disrupted by "civilization."  The key is the
      biological soil crust: a knobby, black crust that is dominated by
      cyanobacteria, but also includes lichens, mosses, green algae,
      microfungi and bacteria.  The crust prevents erosion, traps
      moisture and seeds, adds nutrients -- all the ingedients needed for
      a vibrant biome even in these challenging conditions.

    <div class="entry" title="16 June 2016" location="Arches" pix="IMG_2174.jpg">
      You'll be shocked to learn that what one sees at Arches National Park
      is... arches.  They came in all sizes and ages.  This
      particularly study example is Turret Arch.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2176.jpg">
      I'm getting a good grasp for the color "sage green."
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2194.jpg">
      Arches has millions of visitors each year, so it takes some effort to
      frame and time a shot to make it look like you have the place to yourself.
      This is Broken Arch.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2206.jpg">
      This is Landscape Arch, which has the longest span of any arch in the
      park.  It seems impossibly thin at places, making you wonder how much
      longer it will be with us.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="15 June 2016" location="Capitol Reef" pix="IMG_2131.jpg">
      Capitol Reef National Park's main attraction is the Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile
      long wrinkle in the earth.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2132.jpg">
      There are signs at each trailhead explaining that there's a $300 fine
      for writing grafitti.  Petroglyphs are okay however, but the window of
      opportunity for that closed 1000 years ago.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2143.jpg">
      If you like hiking arid canyons, I recommend Capitol Gorge, the home
      of the petroglyph shown above.  Here I've climbed to the top of the gorge
      to see a genuine water pocket (which turns out to be a depression
      in the rock holding water, vastly oversold as a tourist destination).

    <div class="entry" title="14 June 2016" location="Grand Staircase-Escalante" pix="IMG_2066.jpg">
      Today we traveled Utah's scenic highway 12 in a 150-mile trip through
      some of the most rugged and remote landscape in the lower 48.  The day
      started by catching the sunrise at Bryce Canyon with the strong
      eastern light adding even more drama to the view.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2077.jpg">
      Then we visited some teenage hoodoos hanging out together away
      from their parents.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2101x.jpg">
      It took the Civilian Conservation Core many years to find a path
      across the rugged canyonlands of the Grand Staircase.  Until
      Highway 12 was completed, the few remote communities had to be
      served by mule train.  Crossing the mountain ridges in the
      distance (today's destination) must have seemed easy by
      comparison.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2107.jpg">
      Later in the day, we had a chance to hike up the Lower Calf Creek
      Falls trail, an interesting mix of desert landscape and lush
      creek-fed foliage along the canyon bottom.
    </div>
 

    <div class="entry" title="13 June 2016" location="Bryce Canyon" pix="IMG_2028.jpg">
      Bryce Canyon is hoodoo central!  To the Paiute the hoodoos are
      the "Legend People," turned to stone by their trickster god
      Coyote as punishment for their bad deeds.  Formed in their rank
      and file, they remind me of a giant version of the burried
      terracotta army of Xian.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2032.jpg">
      To a geologist, hoodoos are fins of sandstone protected from erosion
      by a stripe of tougher rock.  Once exposed, cracks form and are
      expanded by the action of water and ice, eventually separating the
      fin into a sequence of separate columns.  The totem-pole profile
      comes from softer layers eroding faster than harder layers.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2035.jpg">
      Hoodoos aren't forever, eventually wearing away to mere nubs and
      eventually a fine, red sand.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2056.jpg">

      picturesque attitudes, and getting themselves photographed, written
      about, and cared for..."  -- Donald Culross Peattie

    <div class="entry" title="12 June 2016" location="Zion" pix="IMG_1979.jpg">
      Zion owes its existence to the Virgin River, which you see here
      emerging from the Narrows into the wider lower canyon.  We're there
      bright and early, with the east light creating a marvelous lightscape
      on the western canyon walls.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_1981.jpg">
      You can actually hike quite far up into the Narrows.  Well, hike
      isn't quite the right word: it's more splashing, wading, or swimming
      in cold water.  Next time we'll rent the right shoes and give it a try!j

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_1983.jpg">
      A 40-minute ride using the Park's convenient shuttle system takes
      you from the lush riparian environment in the north...
