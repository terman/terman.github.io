    <h2>Canyons!  &mdash; Summer 2016</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="16 June 2016" location="Arches" pix="IMG_2174.jpg">
      You'll be shocked to learn that what one sees at Arches National Park
      is... arches.  They came in all sizes and ages.  This
      particularly study example is Turret Arch.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2176.jpg">
      I'm getting a good grasp for the color "sage green."
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2194.jpg">
      Arches has millions of visitors each year, so it takes some effort to
      frame and time a shot to make it look like you have the place to yourself.
      This is Broken Arch.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2206.jpg">
      This is Landscape Arch, which has the longest span of any arch in the
      park.  It seems impossibly thin at places, making you wonder how much
      longer it will be with us.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="15 June 2016" location="Capitol Reef" pix="IMG_2131.jpg">
      Capitol Reef National Park's main attraction is the Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile
      long wrinkle in the earth.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2132.jpg">
      There are signs at each trailhead explaining that there's a $300 fine
      for writing grafitti.  Petroglyphs are okay however, but the window of
      opportunity for that closed 1000 years ago.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2143.jpg">
      If you like hiking arid canyons, I recommend Capitol Gorge, the home
      of the petroglyph shown above.  Here I've climbed to the top of the gorge
      to see a genuine water pocket (which turns out to be a depression
      in the rock holding water, vastly oversold as a tourist destination).

    <div class="entry" title="14 June 2016" location="Grand Staircase-Escalante" pix="IMG_2066.jpg">
      Today we traveled Utah's scenic highway 12 in a 150-mile trip through
      some of the most rugged and remote landscape in the lower 48.  The day
      started by catching the sunrise at Bryce Canyon with the strong
      eastern light adding even more drama to the view.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2077.jpg">
      Then we visited some teenage hoodoos hanging out together away
      from their parents.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2101x.jpg">
      It took the Civilian Conservation Core many years to find a path
      across the rugged canyonlands of the Grand Staircase.  Until
      Highway 12 was completed, the few remote communities had to be
      served by mule train.  Crossing the mountain ridges in the
      distance (today's destination) must have seemed easy by
      comparison.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2107.jpg">
      Later in the day, we had a chance to hike up the Lower Calf Creek
      Falls trail, an interesting mix of desert landscape and lush
      creek-fed foliage along the canyon bottom.
    </div>
 

    <div class="entry" title="13 June 2016" location="Bryce Canyon" pix="IMG_2028.jpg">
      Bryce Canyon is hoodoo central!  To the Paiute the hoodoos are
      the "Legend People," turned to stone by their trickster god
      Coyote as punishment for their bad deeds.  Formed in their rank
      and file, they remind me of a giant version of the burried
      terracotta army of Xian.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2032.jpg">
      To a geologist, hoodoos are fins of sandstone protected from erosion
      by a stripe of tougher rock.  Once exposed, cracks form and are
      expanded by the action of water and ice, eventually separating the
      fin into a sequence of separate columns.  The totem-pole profile
      comes from softer layers eroding faster than harder layers.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2035.jpg">
      Hoodoos aren't forever, eventually wearing away to mere nubs and
      eventually a fine, red sand.
    </div>

      picturesque attitudes, and getting themselves photographed, written
      about, and cared for..."  -- Donald Culross Peattie

    <div class="entry" title="12 June 2016" location="Zion" pix="IMG_1979.jpg">
      Zion owes its existence to the Virgin River, which you see here
      emerging from the Narrows into the wider lower canyon.  We're there
      bright and early, with the east light creating a marvelous lightscape
      on the western canyon walls.
    </div>
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_1981.jpg">
      You can actually hike quite far up into the Narrows.  Well, hike
      isn't quite the right word: it's more splashing, wading, or swimming
      in cold water.  Next time we'll rent the right shoes and give it a try!j

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_1983.jpg">
      A 40-minute ride using the Park's convenient shuttle system takes
      you from the lush riparian environment in the north...

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_1999.jpg">
      through the former canyon-bottom farmlands of the Mormons in the
      middle...

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2005.jpg">
      to the arid high-dessert landscape at the southern end of the Park.
