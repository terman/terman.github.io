    <h2>Canyons!  &mdash; Summer 2016</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="13 June 2016" location="Bryce Canyon" pix="IMG_2028.jpg">
      Bryce Canyon is hoodoo central!  To the Paiute the hoodoos are
      the "Legend People," turned to stone by their trickster god
      Coyote as punishment for their bad deeds.  Formed in their rank
      and file, they remind me of a giant version of the burried
      terracotta army of Xian.

      To a geologist, hoodoos are fins of sandstone protected from erosion
      by a stripe of tougher rock.  Once exposed, cracks form and are
      expanded by the action of water and ice, eventually separating the
      fin into a sequence of separate columns.  The totem-pole profile
      comes from softer layers eroding faster than harder layers.

      Hoodoos aren't forever, eventually wearing away to mere nubs and
      eventually a fine, red sand.

      picturesque attitudes, and getting themselves photographed, written
      about, and cared for..."  -- Donald Culross Peattie

    <div class="entry" title="12 June 2016" location="Zion" pix="IMG_1979.jpg">
      Zion owes its existence to the Virgin River, which you see here
      emerging from the Narrows into the wider lower canyon.  We're there
      bright and early, with the east light creating a marvelous lightscape
      on the western canyon walls.

      You can actually hike quite far up into the Narrows.  Well, hike
      isn't quite the right word: it's more splashing, wading, or swimming
      in cold water.  Next time we'll rent the right shoes and give it a try!j
