    Some hikes have little surprises waiting for you. Today's hike
    included this 200' long suspension bridge over a deep ravine. This
    one was particularly springy and the crosswind blowing up the ravine
    added a bit of sway, which made for an interesting 5 minutes.

    But the bridge was just the warm up for the individual narrow
    metal steps down the 300' cliff face. Reminded me of the Nintendo
    video game where you have to get Mario from floating platform to
    floating platform, but without the extra lives. Maybe next time I'll
    take a moment to translate the warning sign at the trailhead :)</p>

    Actually, more like Berghaus (mountain inn) of the day. The Swiss
    are good at tucking the se inns into scenic corners along the popular
    walking routes.  They vary from mountain huts with very simple
    fare to full-blown restaurants like this one. In all cases the
    cheapest drink on the menu is beer -- the Swiss are clear on their
    priorities.  The remote huts are supplied by helicopter. This
    Berghaus has its own little cable car for bringing up supplies from a
    cog railway station far below. Open inns fly a Swiss flag -- always a
    welcome sight when you're starting to feel peckish!

    On the slopes of Mt. Rigi looking down on the clouds and Lake
    Lucern. Many opportunities on today's tromp through the high
    meadows to commune with contented cows, who said to say "hi". Or
    maybe it was "remember to clean your shoes."

    Many times we gain access to the high meadows via trails that
    climb up the steep valleys cut by the streams that carry the snow
    melt and runoff from the glaciers. Here we're walking down from
    Trift, a mountain hotel that services ice climbers tackling the
    glaciers we passed earlier in the day. You can just make out the
    Gornergrat on the top of the distant ridge, a tourist destination
    that overlooks a spectacular collection of glaciers on the far
    side. Sadly, glaciers are a sight that might be gone in a couple
    of generations.

    And here's the most famous alp view of all: the Matterhorn,
    dominating the skyline above Zermatt, which you can see in the
    valley below. Actually the word "alp" refers to the high mountain
    meadows where the cows spend the summer grazing. Not many cows in
    the Matter valley though -- probably crowded out by the tourists
    :). But a hiking trail headed up quickly thins the crowd to the
    intrepid few.

    This is the view from our balcony looking toward the Breithorn,
    the snow-covered peak in the distance. The hotel is high above
    tourist-filled Zermatt at the first stop of a gondola system that
    reaches up to the winter ski areas nestled under the
    Matterhorn. The cool mountain air is a pleasant relief from the
    muggy lowlands we passed through today as we traveled to Zermatt.

    View down into the Lauterbrunnen valley as I leave Wengen on the
    train, headed to Zurich to meet Debbie. This is a classic U-shaped
    valley carved by glaciers. The sides are sheer cliffs up to 2700'
    high, perfect for BASE jumping or paragliding. Time to order my
    wing suit!

    Wengen, the town where we're staying, is visible on the plateau
    across the valley. The snow-covered peaks beyond are "the top of
    Europe": left to right in the center are the Eiger, Monch, and
    Jungfrau. &nbsp;We've hiked up to the Lobhornhutte, which wins the
    award for the mountain hut with the best view. Note the Nepalese
    prayer flags on the right -- they were collecting donations for
    earthquake relief in Nepal, one mountain community to another.

    The Schreckhorn (yup, that's its name) reflected in the
    Bachalpsee. Even at 8500' it w as a warm day -- should'a jumped
    in!
