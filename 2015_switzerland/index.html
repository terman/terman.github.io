    <h2>Alp of the Day  &mdash; Summer 2015</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="26 August 2015" location="Saas-Fee" pix="IMG_1771.JPG">
      Some hikes have little surprises waiting for you. Today's hike
      included this 200' long suspension bridge over a deep ravine. This
      one was particularly springy and the crosswind blowing up the ravine
      added a bit of sway, which made for an interesting 5 minutes.

      But the bridge was just the warm up for the individual narrow
      metal steps down the 300' cliff face. Reminded me of the Nintendo
      video game where you have to get Mario from floating platform to
      floating platform, but without the extra lives. Maybe next time I'll
      take a moment to translate the warning sign at the trailhead :)

      Actually, this entry is more like "Berghaus (mountain inn) of
      the day". The Swiss are good at tucking these inns into scenic
      corners along the popular walking routes.  They vary from
      mountain huts with very simple fare to full-blown restaurants
      like this one. In all cases the cheapest drink on the menu is
      beer &mdash; the Swiss are clear on their priorities.  The remote
      huts are supplied by helicopter. This Berghaus has its own
      little cable car for bringing up supplies from a cog railway
      station far below. Open inns fly a Swiss flag &mdash; always a
      welcome sight when you're starting to feel peckish!

      On the slopes of Mt. Rigi looking down on the clouds and Lake
      Lucern. Many opportunities on today's tromp through the high
      meadows to commune with contented cows, who said to say "hi." Or
      maybe it was "remember to clean your shoes."
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="20 August 2015" location="Weggis" pix="IMG_1600.JPG">
      We've moved on to Weggis, comfortably situated on the shores of
      Lake Lucern.  The lake is surrounded by forested hills, with a
      couple of mountains thrown in for a hiking challenge.  There's a
      shady lakeside promenade that turns the commute to the boat dock
      into a delightful stroll through this quiet community. A very
      different vibe from our usual mountain villages.

      Walking back to the hotel along the shores of Lake Lucern after
      a yummy dinner of fried perch.  Weggis became a tourist attraction
      after Mark Twain wrote an account of a 3-day walk up Mt. Rigi, the
      gentle giant of the neighborhood that sits benignly above the town.

    <div class="entry" title="12 August 2015" location="Bettmeralp" pix="IMG_1563.JPG">
      Day off from hiking so visited the Aletsch glacier which flows
      down the southern side of the Jungfrau massif.  The view here is
      from Bettmerhorn which we reached via two trains, a cable car,
      and two gondola trips.  This glacier is formed by the
      convergence of three firns, the accumulation zone where snow is
      slowly compacted in glacial ice. The edge moraines of each firm
      form the medial moraines (black stripes in the middle of the
      ice) that you see here.  The ice moves downhill at an inch an
      hour but melting has resulted in a steady retreat over the past
      several centuries.  No big signs predicting the imminent demise
      of this glacier though &mdash; it's over 3000' thick at its thickest
      point.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="12 August 2015" location="Zermatt" pix="IMG_1556.JPG">
      Many times we gain access to the high meadows via trails that
      climb up the steep valleys cut by the streams that carry the snow
      melt and runoff from the glaciers. Here we're walking down from
      Trift, a mountain hotel that services ice climbers tackling the
      glaciers we passed earlier in the day. You can just make out the
      Gornergrat on the top of the distant ridge, a tourist destination
      that overlooks a spectacular collection of glaciers on the far
      side. Sadly, glaciers are a sight that might be gone in a couple
      of generations.

    <div class="entry" title="11 August 2015" location="Zermatt" pix="IMG_1538.JPG">
      And here's the most famous alp view of all: the Matterhorn,
      dominating the skyline above Zermatt, which you can see in the
      valley below. Actually the word "alp" refers to the high mountain
      meadows where the cows spend the summer grazing. Not many cows in
      the Matter valley though &mdash; probably crowded out by the tourists
      :). But a hiking trail headed up quickly thins the crowd to the
      intrepid few.

    <div class="entry" title="10 August 2015" location="Zermatt" pix="IMG_1517.JPG">
      This is the view from our balcony looking toward the Breithorn,
      the snow-covered peak in the distance. The hotel is high above
      tourist-filled Zermatt at the first stop of a gondola system that
      reaches up to the winter ski areas nestled under the
      Matterhorn. The cool mountain air is a pleasant relief from the
      muggy lowlands we passed through today as we traveled to Zermatt.

    <div class="entry" title="9 August 2015" location="Wengen" pix="IMG_1498.JPG">
      View down into the Lauterbrunnen valley as I leave Wengen on the
      train, headed to Zurich to meet Debbie. This is a classic U-shaped
      valley carved by glaciers. The sides are sheer cliffs up to 2700'
      high, perfect for BASE jumping or paragliding. Time to order my
      wing suit!

      It's hard to look noble with a pigeon on one's head...
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="8 August 2015" location="Wengen" pix="IMG_1489.JPG">
      Wengen, the town where we're staying, is visible on the plateau
      across the valley. The snow-covered peaks beyond are "the top of
      Europe": left to right in the center are the Eiger, Monch, and
      Jungfrau.  We've hiked up to the Lobhornhutte, which wins the
      award for the mountain hut with the best view. Note the Nepalese
      prayer flags on the right &mdash; they were collecting donations for
      earthquake relief in Nepal, one mountain community to another.

      The Schreckhorn (yup, that's its name) reflected in the
      Bachalpsee. Even at 8500' it was a warm day &mdash; should'a jumped
      in!
