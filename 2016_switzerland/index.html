    <h2>Wengen Wanderwegs  &mdash; Summer 2016</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="31 July 2016" location="Leiterhorn" pix="IMG_2606.JPG">
      Meadows, chalets, snow covered peaks... this must be Switzerland!
      In this case a view up the Lauterbrunnen valley on the way up to
      the Leiterhorn.  Wengen is the town on the left, perched 1500' above
      the floor of the valley.  A light rain is keeping the scenery lush
      and green, but I'm momentarily dry on a bench nestled under a fir.
      I'm listening to the patter of the rain and church bells
      accompanied by distant cow bells.  (Click <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT5rS_ZPglg" target="_blank">here</A> to hear them for yourself!)

      Wengen is car-free and can only be reached by cog railway.  The trains
      run frequently from 5a to 1a and connect seamlessly with the extensive
      Swiss transporation system.  I've found the trains and buses to be
      super-reliable -- I think they could make all of Switzerland
      car-free and folks would still be able function.
