    <h2>Wengen Wanderwegs  &mdash; Summer 2016</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="1 August 2016" location="Lauterbrunnen -- ZweilÃ¼tchinen -- Grindelwald" pix="IMG_2623.jpg">
      Water is big in Switerland -- glaciers and rivers are resposible for
      much of the justifiably famous scenery.  Of course, Swiss rivers aren't
      allowed to just plunge willy-nilly wherever they wish.  There's a lot
      of engineering to control their flow, generate electricity, etc.  Here's
      a dam (associated at one time with a 19th century mill I think) with a fish
      ladder on the left.  I'm not sure I understand yet how the fish know to
      use the ladder, but I'm sure Swiss fish figure it out ;)

      No respectable chalet is without its flowers, mostly shades of red
      naturally.  Friendly pottery gnomes are optional.  If you want to
      make a fortune, corner the red geranium market here in Switzerland
      -- every window box on every chalet (or so it seems) uses them.

      If the valley is wide enough, you'll see many fields used as pasture.
      In the summer when the cows are in the high alps (alp refers to both
      the mountains and the high meadows on their upper slopes) the fields
      are used to raise grass as fodder.  The meadows always look well groomed
      as the grass is cut frequently.  My yard should look so good!

      A cow wash?  Another business idea: cow detailing for the Swiss farmer
      looking to win another cow-bell prize.

      Meadows, chalets, snow covered peaks... this must be Switzerland!
      In this case a view up the Lauterbrunnen valley on the way up to
      the Leiterhorn.  Wengen is the town on the left, perched 1500' above
      the floor of the valley.  A light rain is keeping the scenery lush
      and green, but I'm momentarily dry on a bench nestled under a fir.
      I'm listening to the patter of the rain and church bells
      accompanied by distant cow bells.  (Click <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT5rS_ZPglg" target="_blank">here</A> to hear them for yourself!)

      Wengen is car-free and can only be reached by cog railway.  The trains
      run frequently from 5a to 1a and connect seamlessly with the extensive
      Swiss transporation system.  I've found the trains and buses to be
      super-reliable -- I think they could make all of Switzerland
      car-free and folks would still be able function.
