    <h2>Wengen Wanderwegs  &mdash; Summer 2016</h2>

    <div class="entry" title="4 August 2016" location="First -- Bachalpsee -- Bussalp" pix="IMG_2707.jpg">
      Bachalpsee is small alpine lake perched high above Grindlewald.  A
      gondola ride makes short work of the climb, so after a 30-min walk
      many hundreds of visitors are soaking in this great view.  So it
      takes a little doing to find a shot that makes it look like I have
      it mostly to myself :)
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2713.jpg">
      Happily there's an alpine trail that leads away from the crowds
      and offers spectacular views of Grindlewald and the big three.
      Well, the big two since from this angle Mönch is hidden behind
      the Eiger.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="3 August 2016" location="Männlichen -- Kleine Scheidegg -- Wengen" pix="IMG_2697.jpg">
      Wengen (where I'm staying) is a resort village nestled comfortably on a plateau
      some 1500' above the floor of the Lauterbrunnen valley, part of what
      the Swiss travel folks call "the Top of Europe".  They've been welcoming
      guests since the 1850's for hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2681.jpg">
      I think much of Wegen's charm is that it's car-free and can only
      be reached by the cog railway connecting Lauterbrunnen (and it's
      very large parking garage!) to Kleine Scheidegg.  It's neat having
      the pedestrians rule the roost for a change!
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2691.jpg">
      I'm guessing that the most popular walk in Switzerland is the route
      from Männlichen (reached by cable car from Wengen) to Kleine Scheidegg.
      Why so popular?  You spend the entire walk (60 mins if you're taking
      your time) looking at the big three: left-to-right we have the
      majestic Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau.  Grabbing our German dictionary,
      we learn that the monk is interposing himself between the ogre and
      the virgin.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2693.jpg">
      This is the hugely busy Kleine Scheidegg train station where
      many 1000's of toursists each day switch to the special cog
      trains to the Jungfraujoch, Europe's highest train station at
      11,332'.  The trains reach the top via a 5.6 mile tunnel through
      Eiger and Monch, a marvel of engineering completed in 1912.  For
      about $200, you too can be part of the throng and visit the
      tourist wonderland they've built on a col under the Jungfrau peak.
      My preference is for a nice quiet alpine trail, but to each their
      own.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="2 August 2016" location="Walenpfad" pix="IMG_2651.jpg">
      The Walenpfad (wales path?) is a classic alpine hike from Bannalp to
      Bruni with the luxurious amenity of cable cars at both ends!  Here's
      the view from top of starting lift.  The trail wends it way left-to-right
      above an alpine lake then across the grassy ridge you see on the far right.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2664.jpg">
      And here's the view from the ridge, looking back towards the starting
      point.  Despite the help from the lift, there's still 2000' of uphill
      to be conquered.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2666.jpg">
      The trails are easy to follow and, assuming the cows haven't trammeled
      them into mud, quite well maintained.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2667.jpg">
      Topping each ridge reveals another, higher ridge to cross.  I thought
      this one was especially handsome, looking almost furry with its lush
      covering of foliage.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2669.jpg">
      And then I discovered the rail runs right along the knife edge!
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2671.jpg">
      At last, the highest elevation on this trail!  Signage is terrific
      and, amazingly, my hiking times closely match those listed on the
      signs.  A great spot for lunch...  What about the view?  Click <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6opkm7QUPxU" target="_blank">here</A> for
      the panorama.
    </div>
    
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2678.jpg">
      Several hours later the end is in sight: the small cluster of buildings
      in the upper left.  Very civilized to have a mountain restaurant where
      I can get my celebratory drink of Apfel Schorle (a beer would go right
      to my head at this point!).
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="1 August 2016" location="Lauterbrunnen -- Zweilütchinen -- Grindelwald" pix="IMG_2623.jpg">
      Water is big in Switerland -- glaciers and rivers are resposible for
      much of the justifiably famous scenery.  Of course, Swiss rivers aren't
      allowed to just plunge willy-nilly wherever they wish.  There's a lot
      of engineering to control their flow, generate electricity, etc.  Here's
      a dam (associated at one time with a 19th century mill I think) with a fish
      ladder on the left.  I'm not sure I understand yet how the fish know to
      use the ladder, but I'm sure Swiss fish figure it out ;)
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2627.jpg,IMG_2639.jpg">
      No respectable chalet is without its flowers, mostly shades of red
      naturally.  Friendly pottery gnomes are optional.  If you want to
      make a fortune, corner the red geranium market here in Switzerland
      -- every window box on every chalet (or so it seems) uses them.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2648.jpg">
      If the valley is wide enough, you'll see many fields used as pasture.
      In the summer when the cows are in the high alps (alp refers to both
      the mountains and the high meadows on their upper slopes) the fields
      are used to raise grass as fodder.  The meadows always look well groomed
      as the grass is cut frequently.  My yard should look so good!
    </div>
    
    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2642.jpg">
      A cow wash?  Another business idea: cow detailing for the Swiss farmer
      looking to win another cow-bell prize.
    </div>

    <div class="entry" title="31 July 2016" location="Leiterhorn" pix="IMG_2606.JPG">
      Meadows, chalets, snow covered peaks... this must be Switzerland!
      In this case a view up the Lauterbrunnen valley on the way up to
      the Leiterhorn.  Wengen is the town on the left, perched 1500' above
      the floor of the valley.  A light rain is keeping the scenery lush
      and green, but I'm momentarily dry on a bench nestled under a fir.
      I'm listening to the patter of the rain and church bells
      accompanied by distant cow bells.  (Click <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT5rS_ZPglg" target="_blank">here</A> to hear them for yourself!)
    </div>

    <div class="entry" pix="IMG_2613.JPG">
      Wengen is car-free and can only be reached by cog railway.  The trains
      run frequently from 5a to 1a and connect seamlessly with the extensive
      Swiss transporation system.  I've found the trains and buses to be
      super-reliable -- I think they could make all of Switzerland
      car-free and folks would still be able function.
